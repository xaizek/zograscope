.SH NAME
.PP
\f[I]zs-stats\f[R] is a tool for counting:
.IP \[bu] 2
lines of code
.IP \[bu] 2
size of functions (complete definition)
.IP \[bu] 2
number of functions
.IP \[bu] 2
number of parameters of functions
.IP \[bu] 2
possibly other things in the future
.SH INVOCATION

Paths can specify both files and directories.
When no path is specified, \[lq].\[rq] is assumed.

here this common option also limits set of files to process
.SH OPERATION
.PP
Differences from some similar tools:
.IP \[bu] 2
counts line containing only braces/brackets/parenthesis separately from
code
.IP \[bu] 2
blank lines inside multiline comments are counted as comments
.IP \[bu] 2
blank lines inside string literals are counted as code
.IP \[bu] 2
can be slower due to parsing source code instead of treating it as text
.IP \[bu] 2
supports a few languages and new ones are harder to add
.IP \[bu] 2
trailing blank lines are ignored (because there are no tree nodes for
them, although it\[cq]s possible to add them)
.IP \[bu] 2
last line continuation in macros in C aren\[cq]t recognized due to lack
of tokenization of preprocessor directives; in C++ it might not be
recognized due to SrcML bugs
