.SH NAME
.PP
\f[I]zs-gdiff\f[R] is a GUI syntax-aware diff that uses Qt5.
See \f[B]zs-diff\f[R](1) for more details and comparison against other
tools.
.PP
The tool can either accept two files on command-line, be integrated with
\f[V]git\f[R] by its means (yet using external GUI tools from
\f[V]git\f[R] isn\[cq]t very convenient in general) or pick up list of
changed files in the repository (staged or unstaged in index or from a
commit) by itself.
The latter way of using \f[V]zs-gdiff\f[R] with \f[V]git\f[R]
doesn\[cq]t require any configuration and allows going through files
without restarting it, unlike when \f[V]git\f[R] invokes external tools.
.PP
It works, but it\[cq]s far from being polished.
